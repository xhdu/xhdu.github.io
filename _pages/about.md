I earned my Ph.D. from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in June 2025, supervised by Assoc.Prof. [Ming Wen](https://mingwen-cs.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained my master's degree in 2021 from [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Jie Yu. 

My research interests encompass **LLM security** and **LLM applications**. Specifically, I investigate adversarial attacks and jailbreaking attacks within the realm of LLM security. Additionally, I apply LLMs to enhance code vulnerability detection, aiming to improve the robustness and effectiveness of security measures in software systems.

If you are interesting in working with me, always feel free to contact me through email or Wechat.
